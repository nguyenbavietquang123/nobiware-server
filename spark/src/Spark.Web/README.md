# Spark.Web

Spark.Web is where you can modify FHIR server Rest API. You can see all the API of FHIR server in ./Controller/FHIR Controller.

# The explaination of some environment in appsetting.json and appsetting.development.
Your FHIR server connects to Keycloak for authentication and authorization. You can either update the following settings to match your own Keycloak domain and realm or leave it by default to run it on local.
**Important**: If you run the app on local via Docker, please replace all the `localhost` with your IP address.
