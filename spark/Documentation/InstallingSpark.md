# Getting Started

## Database

Spark FHIR server supports MongoDB as itÂ´s persistence layer. The following options are supported:

- MongoDB Atlas. Sign up for a [free trial account](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) and run your database in the cloud.
- MongoDB Community Server. [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) and install locally
- MongoDB Enterprise. [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise) and install locally.
- MongoDB in docker. Check out the example [docker-compose-example.yml](../.docker/docker-compose.example.yml).

## CosmoDB with MongoDB as a database
In general we do not recommend using CosmosDB. There are known installations using CosmosDB with MongoDB API which runs fairly well, but it has not been without problems.

## Install Spark

The core packages `Spark.Engine` and `Spark.Mongo` targets `net8.0` and `net9.0`. For the web application you may choose between:

## Reference Implementations
The reference implementations are only meant as examples and must never be used out of the box in a production environment without adding as a minimum security features.

- `Spark.Web` which runs on ASP.Net 9.0.
